University of Oxford - Hilary 2025

## Description

This course introduces students to contemporary frameworks of "counterfactual" causal inference, emphasizing the complementarities between potential outcomes (a.k.a., Neyman-Rubin causal model) and the structural causal model (a.k.a., Wright-Pearl graphical approach). The focus is on identification and estimation of causal effects using observational data as encountered in social science applications.
