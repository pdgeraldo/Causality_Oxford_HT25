# Classical diff-in-diff {background-color="#17a091"}

## Motivating example

[Card and Krueger, 1994](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf)

![](img\card_krueger_1994.png)

## Basic ingredients

The simplest difference-in-differences requires information from two groups (treated vs control), in two time periods (pre-treatment for everyone vs post-treatment for the exposed group)

The basic idea is to use repeated observations over time to adjust for baseline differences between groups, and temporal trends. 

(Usually described as accounting for "time invariant unobserved confounding")

Our target quantity is the average treatment effect on the treated in the post-exposure period:

$$
E[Y_{1,post}|D=1] - E[Y_{0,post}|D=1]
$$

## Missing potential outcome

$$
E[\color{blue}{Y_{1,post}|D=1}] - E[\color{red}{Y_{0,post}|D=1}]
$$

It is easy to notice that:

* Assuming consistency (SUTVA), the blue term can be [directly observed]{style="color:blue"}

* However, the red term is [missing]{style="color:red"}! We need candidates to fill in this empty cell

## Candidate comparisons

Let's check some candidates to fill in for $$\color{red}{E[Y_{0,post}|D=1]}$$

(Recall that we have our data in a 2x2 matrix)

|    |      $D=0$      |  $D=1$ |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| $T=pre$ |  $\color{grey}{Y_{0,pre}|D=0}$ | $\color{grey}{Y_{0,pre}|D=1}$ |
| $T=post$ |    $\color{grey}{Y_{0,post}|D=0}$   |  $\color{blue}{Y_{1,post}|D=1}$  |


## Candidate comparisons

Let's check some candidates to fill in for $$\color{red}{E[Y_{0,post}|D=1]}$$

(Recall that we have our data in a 2x2 matrix)

|    |      $D=0$      |  $D=1$ |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| $T=pre$ |  $\color{grey}{Y_{0,pre}|D=0}$ | $\color{grey}{Y_{0,pre}|D=1}$ |
| $T=post$ |    $\color{red}{Y_{0,post}|D=0}$   |  $\color{blue}{Y_{1,post}|D=1}$  |


## Candidate comparisons

Let's check some candidates to fill in for $$\color{red}{E[Y_{0,post}|D=1]}$$

(Recall that we have our data in a 2x2 matrix)

|    |      $D=0$      |  $D=1$ |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| $T=pre$ |  $\color{grey}{Y_{0,pre}|D=0}$ | $\color{red}{Y_{0,pre}|D=1}$ |
| $T=post$ |    $\color{grey}{Y_{0,post}|D=0}$   |  $\color{blue}{Y_{1,post}|D=1}$  |

## Candidate comparisons

Let's check some candidates to fill in for $$\color{red}{E[Y_{0,post}|D=1]}$$

(Recall that we have our data in a 2x2 matrix)

|    |      $D=0$      |  $D=1$ |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| $T=pre$ |  $\color{red}{Y_{0,pre}|D=0}$ | $\color{red}{Y_{0,pre}|D=1}$ |
| $T=post$ |    $\color{red}{Y_{0,post}|D=0}$   |  $\color{blue}{Y_{1,post}|D=1}$  |


## Candidate estimator

We can use the 2x2 matrix to combine information across groups and time periods:

$$
\delta = \big(E[Y|D=1,Post] - E[Y|D=1, Pre] \big) - \big(E[Y|D=0,Post] - E[Y|D=0, Pre] \big)
$$

By consistency, we can write

$$
\delta = \big(E[Y_1|D=1,Post] - E[Y_0|D=1,Pre] \big) - \big(E[Y_0|D=0,Post] - E[Y_0|D=0,Pre] \big)
$$

## Sources of bias


Now, we can add zero

$$
\delta = \big(E[Y_1|D=1,Post] - E[Y_0|D=1,Pre] \big) - \big(E[Y_0|D=0,Post] - E[Y_0|D=0,Pre] \big)
$$ 

$$
+ \color{red}{E[Y_0|D=1, Post] -E[Y_0|D=1, Post]}
$$
Recombining the terms, we get:

$$
\delta = \underbrace{E[Y_1|D=1,Post] - \color{red}{E[Y_0|D=1,Post]}}_{ATT}
$$

$$
+ \underbrace{\big(\color{red}{E[Y_0|D=1,Post]} - E[Y_0|D=1,Pre]\big) - \big(E[Y_0|D=0,Post] - E[Y_0|D=0,Pre]\big)}_{\text{Bias due to non-parallel trends}}
$$


## Identification assumptions

Therefore, the identification assumptions we need for the Diff-in-diff estimator to be consistent is called *parallel trends*

$$
E(\Delta Y_0|D=1) = E(\Delta Y_0|D=0)
$$

Or, in a maybe more familiar notation, 

$$
\Delta Y_0 \indep D
$$

$$

$$

$$
\Delta Y_0 \indep D
$$

As with other identification assumptions, parallel trends is an unverifiable assumption! Why???

. . .

* It's an assumption about counterfactual variables!

* It's not equivalent to "pre-trajectories" 

* However, checking for possible pre-trends is a common and good practice! ("event study")

## Identification assumptions

Additionally, and similarly to other strategies, we need extra assumptions:

* SUTVA or consistency

* No anticipation

And, as usual, the critical question is *why should we believe that these assumptions are reasonable?*

* What do we understand about the assignment process?

* What do we understand about the outcome process?

* What is the role of covariates in our analysis, if any?



## TWFE estimation

The difference-in-difference estimator can be easily written in a regression form:

$$
E(Y) = \alpha + \gamma D + \lambda T + \delta (D \times T)
$$

Where,

$\alpha$: untreated, pre period

$\alpha + \gamma$: (not yet) treated, pre period

$\alpha + \lambda$: untreated, post period

$\alpha + \gamma + \lambda + \delta$: treated, post period

. . .

This is known as the two-way fixed effect model


# Problems with TWFE {background-color="#17a091"}

It is tempting to apply the same logic and extend the TWFE model for multiple time period and multiple groups.

But not so fast!

Now we know this bring it own (many) issues:

* When treatment status is non-absorbing

* When treatment effect is heterogeneous across units and time

* Think about design vs model-based arguments
